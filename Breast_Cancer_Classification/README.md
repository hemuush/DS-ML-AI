Problem Statement :
Predict is the Cancer Diagosis is benign or maligant based on several observation features

After applying the different classification models, we have got below accuracies with different models:
1. Logistic Regression -- 98.5%
2. Nearest Neighbor -- 95.1%
3. Support Vector Machines -- 95.1%
4. Kernel SVM -- 96.5%
5. Naive Bayes -- 93.7%
6. Decision Tree Algorithm -- 94.4%
7. Random Forest Classification -- 97.9%

# As we see Random Forest Classification give the best result for our dataset.
